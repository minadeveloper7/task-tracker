## Example Commands

### Adding a New Task

```bash
java -jar target/task-tracker-cli-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar add "Buy groceries"
# Output: Task added successfully (ID: 1)
```

### Updating and Deleting Tasks

```bash
java -jar target/task-tracker-cli-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar update 1 "Buy groceries and cook dinner"
java -jar target/task-tracker-cli-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar delete 1
```

### Marking a Task as In Progress or Done

```bash
java -jar target/task-tracker-cli-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar mark-in-progress 1
java -jar target/task-tracker-cli-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar mark-done 1
```

### Listing Tasks by Status

```bash
java -jar target/task-tracker-cli-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar list
java -jar target/task-tracker-cli-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar list done
java -jar target/task-tracker-cli-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar list todo
java -jar target/task-tracker-cli-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar list in-progress
```

---

## Task Properties

Each task in the JSON file includes the following properties:

- **id**: Unique identifier for the task
- **description**: Short description of the task
- **status**: Task status (`todo`, `in-progress`, or `done`)
- **createdAt**: Timestamp when the task was created
- **updatedAt**: Timestamp when the task was last updated

### Sample JSON Structure

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "description": "Buy groceries",
    "status": "todo",
    "createdAt": "2024-10-26T12:00:00Z",
    "updatedAt": "2024-10-26T12:00:00Z"
  }
]
```

---

## Error Handling

The CLI handles various edge cases gracefully:

- Invalid task IDs
- Missing or incorrect arguments
- JSON file read/write issues (file will be created if not present)

### Example Errors

- **Invalid Command**:
  ```bash
  java -jar target/task-tracker-cli-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar unknown-command
  # Output: Error - Unknown command
  ```
- **Missing Arguments**:
  ```bash
  java -jar target/task-tracker-cli-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar update
  # Output: Error - Task ID is required for updating
  ```

## Setting Up an Alias (Linux/macOS)

To simplify running the application, you can create an alias in your shell configuration file. Follow these steps:

### 1. Open Your Shell Configuration File

Depending on your shell, open the appropriate configuration file:

- For **Bash** users:

  ```bash
  nano ~/.bashrc
  ```

- For **Zsh** users:

  ```bash
  nano ~/.zshrc
  ```

### 2. Add the Alias

Add the following line to the file:

```bash
alias task-cli='java -jar /path/to/your/project/target/task-tracker-cli-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar'
```

> Replace `/path/to/your/project` with the actual path to your project directory.

### 3. Save the File and Reload Your Shell Configuration

After adding the alias, save the file and reload your shell configuration with:

- For **Bash** users:

  ```bash
  source ~/.bashrc
  ```

- For **Zsh** users:

  ```bash
  source ~/.zshrc
  ```

### 4. Running the Application

You can now run your application using the following command:

```bash
task-cli <command> [options]
```
